# The HH Color Picker

This is a fun little color picker that generates random color and allows a user to pick a color swatch from a bunch of randomly generated colors. Right now the total numbers generated is 100 but this is relatively easy to change by updating the `totalNumberOfColors` variable in `src/component/App/index.js`. Upon clicking on a color swatch the website generates two color swatches with lighter luminosity and two color swatches with darker luminosity. A user can hit the clear button to go back.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
a computer, the internet, and much brawndo to stay hydrated
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
